## Overview  
*Unstable Memory* is an experimental audiovisual instrument built for live performance, improvisation, and exploratory sound design.

It blends Web Audio DSP, glitch-driven modulation, VHS-inspired visual distortion, and interactive UI elements to create unstable sonic behaviours and emergent textures.

This project represents the technical side of my practice — building tools that expand the creative possibilities of sound.
