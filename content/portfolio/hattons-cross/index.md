## Hatton’s Cross  
*Animated Short / Sound Design & Music*

During the first lockdown, I collaborated along with Matty Bane of The Horses of the Gods, with **Fable Feast**, a London-based immersive theatre company, to bring *Hatton’s Cross*, a poem by **Jim Jack**, to life as an eerie, folk-horror inspired animated short.

Working alongside actor **Benjamin Peter Jones** and a small team of animators, I was responsible for shaping the film’s sonic world, combining dialogue, field recordings, atmospheric sound design, and subtle musical textures to support the poem’s tone and imagery.

### Sound Design Approach

The unusually quiet period of the first lockdown period became a defining influence on the project. With traffic noise almost entirely absent, natural and environmental sounds took on a heightened presence. This shift prompted an exploration of how sound, or its absence, shapes our emotional relationship to place.

Field recordings captured during solitary woodland walks formed the foundation of the soundscape. These recordings were layered, processed, and shaped in the DAW to create an uneasy sense of space, distance, and stillness. Organic ambiences were combined with restrained, unsettling textures to enhance the poem’s eerie and reflective qualities.

### Creative Focus

- Environmental and atmospheric sound design  
- Field recording during lockdown conditions  
- Dialogue integration and spatial placement  
- Subtle musical underscoring to support narrative tone  
- Mixing decisions driven by mood rather than realism  

The result is a sparse but immersive sonic environment that mirrors the themes of isolation, memory, and unease present in both the poem and the wider moment in which it was created.

### Watch

For the best experience, dim the lights, turn up the volume, and allow the sound to lead you through the piece.
