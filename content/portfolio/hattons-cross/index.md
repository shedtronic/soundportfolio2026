## Overview  
*Hattons Cross* is a fully developed animated short created during the COVID lockdown period.  
The project combines character-driven sound design, environmental atmospheres, musical cues, and integrated voice acting.

Working with writers, animators, and actors, I created the full sonic identity for the film — from dialogue edit to final mix.
