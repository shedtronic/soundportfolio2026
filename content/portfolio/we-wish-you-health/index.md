## Overview  
*We Wish You Health* is a narrative-driven soundworld exploring folk horror, ritual atmospheres, and the liminal spaces between composition and sound design.

Blending radiophonic textures, acoustic instruments, field recordings, and spectral processing, the project forms a sonic mythology rooted in place, memory, and collective folklore.
