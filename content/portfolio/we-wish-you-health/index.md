## We Wish You Health  
*Album — Composition, Sound Design, Mixing & Mastering*

*We Wish You Health* is the debut album by **The Horses of the Gods**, and a project that strongly reflects my approach to sound, atmosphere, and resourceful production.

The album was recorded slowly and deliberately, working almost entirely with **acoustic instruments, minimal equipment, and a pared-back recording setup**. Rather than relying on studio excess, the focus was on performance, texture, space, and narrative continuity, assembling the album like a sonic puzzle, where each piece supports the whole.

Despite the limited setup, the record achieves a sense of depth, warmth, and intimacy. Mixing and mastering were completed entirely on an older laptop, with careful attention paid to balance, dynamics, and clarity. This constraint-driven workflow helped shape the album’s distinctive character: **raw, sparse, organic, and quietly unsettling**, drawing on folk traditions while leaning into a hauntological, atmospheric soundworld.

One of the album’s standout tracks, *John Barleycorn*, continues to find a growing audience across streaming platforms. Its reception has reinforced the value of subtle mixing decisions — allowing space, restraint, and dynamic movement to do the work rather than over-processing.

Beyond the music itself, *We Wish You Health* was an important exercise in **DIY audio engineering and intentional limitation**. The final masters were optimised for Spotify, Apple Music, and Bandcamp, ensuring consistent translation across platforms while preserving the album’s organic feel.

This project reinforced a core belief that continues to inform my work:

> **Strong sound design and musical impact come from listening, intention, and technique — not equipment alone.**

The experience has directly informed my most recent projects and continues to influence my approach to soundtrack work, immersive audio, and long-form atmospheric composition. Since completing the album, I’ve also undertaken further study in mastering, which is feeding into the early stages of the next Horses of the Gods release.
