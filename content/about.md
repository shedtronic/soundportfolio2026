# About

I’m a sound designer and multi-instrumentalist with a background in experimental music, field recording, and immersive media. I approach every project with a focus on emotional resonance.

I’ve always been drawn to the relationship between place, sound, and music, and my work reflects this by merging real-world recordings with composition, sound design, and dynamic audio systems.

Alongside experimental and procedural approaches, I regularly create soundtracks, themes, and atmospheric scores for film, games, and interactive media. My experience spans collaborative projects including full sound design and original music for animated shorts, game audio systems, and immersive sonic environments that support narrative, emotion, and world-building.

## What I Do
- Atmospheric sound design for film, games and interactive media
- Original composition, themes, and soundtrack work 
- Field recording, Foley, and environmental sound creation 
- EExperimental and procedural audio systems  
- Immersive media, installations, and live performance
