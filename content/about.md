# About

I’m a sound designer and multi-instrumentalist whose practice is rooted in listening to place, atmosphere, and the traces environments leave behind. I work with field recording, experimental processes, and immersive audio to create environments that feel inhabited, often shaped by subtle instability, tension, and emotional resonance.

I’m drawn to the relationship between sound, memory, and landscape, and I often merge real-world recordings with composition, sound design, and dynamic audio systems to support narrative and world-building. My work spans film, games, and interactive/immersive media, from full sound design and original music to reactive soundscapes and procedural audio approaches.

## What I Do
- Atmospheric sound design for film, games and interactive media
- Original composition, themes, and soundtrack work
- Field recording, Foley, and environmental sound creation 
- Experimental and procedural audio systems  
- Immersive media, installations, and live performance  


## How I Work



- Collaborative, responsive, iteration-friendly
- Clear versioning and deliveries
- Happy working from a brief or exploring early concepts together
